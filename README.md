Entry Level Cyber Security Professional
---------------------------------------

I've completed a Cyber Security professional course with Google, I am a passion driven individual looking forward to having a career in Cyber Security. What intrigues me about a career in cyber security is the ever-changing nature of threats, as attackers are constantly evolving with their techniques to attack new technologies, cyber security professionals are also on their toes to curb the menace and danger they pose. This makes Cyber security professionals always try and evolve and get better to tackle threat actors. Although cyber security is a diverse and ever-evolving field that I would like to have a broad knowledge of, I would like to learn more about Security Operations and Monitoring and also Explore security operations centers (SOCs) and security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and how I can apply the to mitigate risks. As a cyber security analyst, I hope to acquire a lot of certificates related to the field, I hope to gain hands-on experience and continue learning, developing my skills, and evolving, network with experienced cyber security professionals, specialize in a niche and be able to contribute to open source projects. I plan to learn and develop my use of SIEM and other tools to mitigate threats and risks as a cyber security professional, my problem-solving and critical thinking skills will be of great help to me as I navigate the world of cyber security. My ability to collaborate and obsession with service will also be of great assistance. My ability to be discreet and my philosophy of always following laid down rules will be my greatest strength and will help me succeed in the cybersecurity space, as the profession is very particular about how professionals handle information (Confidentiality, and Integrity.)
